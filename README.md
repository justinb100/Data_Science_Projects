# Data_Science_Projects

This repository contains a few projects I have been working on related to data science and machine learning with ipython notebooks. All folders should contain all the files needed to replicate the notebooks.  

## Auto_MPG:
Regression project where we try to predict an automobile's fuel fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG) based on car attributes. Steps include pre-processing data with imputation and scaling, train/test splitting, model selection through cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to get the best regression model for predicting a car's fuel efficiency.

## California_Housing:
Notebook created for a regression problem, with the California Housing dataset and guidelines taken from Chapter 2 of the [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) textbook. The data analysis and model development follows along with the textbook, but I try to explore further and make the problem-solving easy to follow for readers. Methods used in the notebook include data exploration, imputing missing values with custom transformers, setting up multi-step pipelines for model training and prediction, hyperparameter tuning using both random and non-random grid search, and estimating the best features for predicting the median housing value in a Californian district.
