# Data_Science_Projects

This repository contains a few projects I have been working on related to data science and machine learning with ipython notebooks. All folders should contain all the files needed to replicate the notebooks.  

## Auto_MPG:
Regression project where we try to predict an automobile's fuel fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG) based on car attributes. Steps include pre-processing data with imputation and scaling, train/test splitting, model selection through cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to get the best regression model for predicting a car's fuel efficiency.
