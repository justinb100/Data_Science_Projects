# Data_Science_Projects

This repository contains a few projects I have been working on related to data science and machine learning. All folders should contain all the files needed to replicate the python notebooks.  

## Auto_MPG:
Regression project where we try to predict an automobile's fuel fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG).
